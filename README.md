Here the assignments for the course.

SINDY_MPC is a code that uses SINDYc as system identification and MPC as controller

> For the NN the procedure is the following:
>
> Run 2_buses_test to create the training data
> Run GRU_model to train the NN
> Run Test_Gru_only_voltage to test the NN on new data
> Run Test_GRU_ciclo to test with 1000 simulation and look the MAE%
